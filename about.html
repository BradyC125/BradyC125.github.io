				<h3>What is SOUP?</h3>
				<p>Soup is a charitable organization founded to help improve community. At each meeting, all attendees 
				are asked to make a donation to enter. Once the meeting starts, everyone will watch as 4 individuals 
				present. Each presenter will represent another charity or nonprofit. They will present for 5 minutes at
				max, and each will have the opportunity to field 3 questions from the audience once they finish
				presenting. After all 4 have presented, attendees will be invited to eat the food provided by either
				resturant sponsors or other attendees who were kind enough to prepare a dish. While eating, attendees
				are encouraged to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each presenter. When they feel ready to do so,
				people who attend are invited to vote for whichever charity they feel deserves support the most. The 
				charity that obtains the most votes by the end of the night is given the entire door prize</p>
