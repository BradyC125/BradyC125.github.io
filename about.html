				<h3>What happens at SOUP?</h3>
				<p class="indent">Soup is a collabrative and democratic microgranting nonprofit organization. For a suggested donation 
				of 5 dollars, anyone who attends receives a vote, a voice, and a dinner. Each meeting begins with 
				presentations by 4 individuals who each represent an organization of their choice. These individuals 
				have 5 minutes to present, after which they can answer up to 3 audience questions. Once these
				presenters finish, we invite all attendees to eat, talk, and share resources among themselves and the
				people they meet. At this time, we also invite anyone attending to vote for whichever charity they 
				think is most deserving of help. At the end of the night, we'll count the votes, and whoever recieced
				the most earns all of the money from the admittance fees. Winners are asked to return to a later meeting
				to share their successes explain how the money was used.</p>
