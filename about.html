			<h3>What happens at SOUP?</h3>
			<p class="indent">Soup is a collabrative and democratic microgranting nonprofit organization. For a 
				suggested donation of 5 dollars, anyone who attends receives a vote, a voice, and a dinner. Each meeting
				begins with presentations by 4 individuals who each represent an organization of their choice. These 
				individuals have 5 minutes to present, after which they can answer up to 3 audience questions. Once
				these presenters finish, we invite all attendees to eat, talk, and share resources among themselves and
				the people they meet. At this time, we also invite anyone attending to vote for whichever charity they 
				think is most deserving of help. At the end of the night, we'll count the votes, and whoever recieced
				the most earns all of the money from the admittance fees. Winners are asked to return to a later meeting
				to share their successes explain how the money was used.</p>
