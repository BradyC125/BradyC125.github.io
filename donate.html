		<h2>Support SOUP</h2>
		<div id="centerCollumn">
			<div>
			<p>BH SOUP is eager to accept any donations you're able to offer. The maintainance of this organization is not 
			nonexistant; we have various overhead expenses like the cost of hosting this website and the cost of providing 
			dinner to the attendees. To pay for these expenses, we're reliant on donations outside of the attmittance fee. 
			We try to reduce these costs as much as possible through our corperate sponsors, whether they provide money or 
			allow us to use their extra food, but we do still accrue some costs. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>When SOUP was founded, we established that our organization would not take from the entrance fees. That money
			belongs to the winner; we have no right to use it for our own purposes. This means, however, that we need 
			donations from people like you to keep from paying out-of-pocket. SOUP, as a nonprofit, keeps none of the money 
			for itself or its members. In fact, any donations in excess of our operating cost will be added to the pot for 
			the next winner to earn.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>We're currently working on a way to make donations towards the door fund possible through electronic means. 
			While we have as of yet been unsucessful, this feature will likely appear soon. If we recieve positive feedback 
			regarding this feature, we will likely be able to create more options to specify the ultimate destination of the
			 donation in future updates to the site.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>If you wish to contribute in a non-monetary way, you have a variety of options. For example, you could bring 
			food to a meeting, or you could attend a meeting of the leadership and help organize (dates and times for both
			events can be found <a href ="events.html" class="socialMediaLink">here</a>). We'd appreciate if you worked to 
			spread the word through <a href="https://twitter.com/bh_soup" class="socialMediaLink">Twitter</a>, 
			<a href="" class="socialMediaLink">Instagram</a>, or in person. We also have fliers 
			<a href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJCnuzB6A7HojYzWn9VHprIjYz6R1w_DKWp8gxAX60c/edit?usp=sharing" 
			class="socialMediaLink">here</a> that you can distribute to help raise awareness. Any contribution helps, and is
			 deeply appreciated.</p><p>If you think your buisness would be interested in sponsoring us or even potentially 
			matching the door prize, please <a href="contact.html" class="socialMediaLink">Contact Us</a> to discuss 
			details. </p>
